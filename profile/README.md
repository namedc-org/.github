namedc.org is an archive of discord username history.

# How do we get information ✍️(◔◡◔)

### Discord Bot 🤖
our discord bot is running and waiting for events like userUpdate and such, 
once it sees one it adds the user who triggered the event to our database

> [bot invite](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1121364536071561327&scope=bot&permissions=0)

### Looking up a user ID 🔎
When you lookup a user ID our database automatically adds the username to our database

# API φ(*￣0￣)
We will soon have a paid api you could use.
